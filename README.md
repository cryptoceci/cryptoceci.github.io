Hello World! I am Cecilia, cryptography researcher and living human being.

### Research interests

My research focuses mainly on designing cryptographic protocols that are secure even if attacked with a quantum computer.
In particular, I like to design lattice-based protocols that can make the (online) world a little more decentralized.

I am currently focusing on protocols that give the users some control on their metadata, in the form of both policy-enforcing encryption and privacy-preserving signature schemes.

You can find a list of my pubblications [here](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pid/216/6219.html).

###### keywords: lattice-based cryptography, access control encryption, group / ring / threshold signatures.

## Geographic location

Currently, I am a PostDoc at the Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana (CH) in the [Cryptography and Quantum Information group](https://cqi.inf.usi.ch/index.php) led by the incomparable Prof. Stefan Wolf.

Previously, I spent 5 years between [IBM Research - Zurich](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/) and USI, the research labs with one of the prettiest views in the world.
There I completed my PhD under the supervision of Dr. Jan Camenisch and Prof. Stefan Wolf.
