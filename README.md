Hello World! I am Cecilia, cryptography researcher and living human being.

### Research interests

My research focuses on designing cryptographic protocols that are secure even if attacked with a quantum computer, and that can make the (online) world a little more decentralized.
This includes (but is not limited to) lattice-based privacy-preserving signature schemes, and protocols that give the users some control on their metadata, such as policy-enforcing encryption.

I am also interested in the analysis and formalization of new assumptions and models, that is, on the foundational work that allows to analyze the new esoteric assumptions usually required to speed up existing constructions based on standard assumptions.

You can find an overview of my scientific and divulgative output [here](./biblio.html).

###### keywords: lattice-based cryptography, access control encryption, group / ring / threshold signatures.

### Where to Find Me

Currently I am a Senior Research Assistant (Oberassistentin) in the group of Prof. Dennis Hofheinz at ETH Zurich (Switzerland).
<!--Yuval Ishai (Technion, IL), and I am part of the <a href="https://www.factcenter.org/">FACT center</a> led by Prof. Elette Boyle (Reichman university, IL).-->

Previously, I spent many years between [IBM Research - Zurich](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/) and the the [CQI group](https://cqi.inf.usi.ch/index.php) led by the incomparable Prof. Stefan Wolf at the Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana (CH), where I completed my PhD under the supervision of Dr. Jan Camenisch and Prof. Stefan Wolf.
