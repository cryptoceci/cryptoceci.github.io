### Scientific Output

You can find a list of my publications [here](./papers.html).

### Books
I co-wrote a book about Discrete Math! It includes the basics needed in CS: set theory, logics, combinatorics, and graph theory. And, obviously, the cherry on top is the last chapter: an introduction to cryptography. The e-book version is free, check it out:

- C. Boschini, A. Hansen, S. Wolf. <i> Discrete Mathematics.</i> Verlag der Fachvereine (VdF), Zurich, 2022 ([link](https://vdf.ch/discrete-mathematics-e-book.html)).

### Divulgative Writing/Talks

- Are you fed up with WhatsApp, but cannot decide between Signal and Telegram? I wrote a security comparison for non-experts to help you out! You can find it [here](https://cqi.inf.usi.ch/publications/telegram_vs_signal.pdf?_gl=1*1rjmplt*_ga*MjA1MDgyOTM4Ni4xNjI2Mjc1NTUw*_ga_89Y0EEKVWP*MTYyNjI3NTU0OS4xLjEuMTYyNjI3NjA5Ny42MA..).

- Are you interested in post-quantum cryptography but have no time? Check out [this 5 min talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kD2ryHMkFA).

- I love designing signatures with fancy features, but they can be very confusing! If you need a high level overview, check out [this post](https://cqi.inf.usi.ch/blog/four.html).
